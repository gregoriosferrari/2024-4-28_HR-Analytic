The balance appeared on the flazz machine after calculating my purchases . I gave the flazz card and made a transaction at the BCA EDC . It seems that this cashier is new because the first time I asked to check the balance , she asked the next cashier . When making a transaction to the BCA EDC , she still asked the next cashier and had to leave the cashier desk . As a result , it will take time and the cashier queue will increase . Apparently , the next cashier also could not make transactions . The 2 cashiers said that my chip was damaged . Helloooo , use logic . Before the initial transaction , you could already check the balance . If my flazz chip was damaged , of course it would not have appeared at the beginning . Yes , I ' m sorry because I felt sorry for the other customers who were still queuing . I decided to change the CIMB Niaga debit card and it failed 2 times the transaction until 2 cashiers had to serve . Finally , I had to run to the side of the parking lot to get cash at the ATM . After I finished paying in cash , there was another employee who was probably a supervisor who approached the cashier and said that it would be reported to the bank about the failure to use the two EDCs . Hahaha , it was too late . I had already run to the ATM . The queue had to be diverted . Isn ' t it now recommended to be cashless ? There are 2 points that management should pay attention to : 1 . Both new and old cashiers should be given training for the use and how to solve if there is a problem with the EDC machine and how to use money , just call the bank team to be able to provide training . Surely the bank will be happy to come . 2 . Ask the bank to do maintenance on the EDC machine more often .\n",
